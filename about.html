        <p>A Star in Telugu Cinema

            Born on **May 28, 1923, in Nimmakuru, Andhra Pradesh, NTR started his acting career in 1949. He became a legend in Telugu cinema, known for his powerful portrayals of gods, kings, and warriors. His roles as Lord Krishna and other mythological figures made him a household name. People saw him as a symbol of strength and justice, a reputation that would later help him in his political career.</p>

        <p>Entering Politics: A Fight for Telugu Pride

            By the early 1980s, NTR felt that the people of Andhra Pradesh needed a leader who truly understood their struggles. The ruling Congress party wasn’t meeting the needs of the people, so NTR decided to enter politics. In 1982, he founded the **Telugu Desam Party (TDP)** with the goal of restoring the self-respect of the Telugu people. His slogan, "**Telugu Atma Gauravam**" (Self-respect for Telugus), resonated deeply with the people.</p>

        <p>The 1983 Election Victory

            In 1983, NTR led the TDP in the state elections, and against all odds, his party won in a huge way. NTR became the **Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh**, marking a new era in state politics. He promised to fight for the poor, bring an end to corruption, and improve the lives of farmers, women, and backward communities.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Key Reforms by NTR</h2>
        <p>Once in power, NTR made several important changes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Welfare for Farmers**: NTR launched programs to help farmers with subsidies and loan waivers.</li>
            <li>Food for the Poor**: He introduced a subsidized rice scheme to help feed the poor.</li>
            <li>Support for Women**: NTR worked on laws to protect women and improve their rights.</li>
            <li>Corruption-Free Government**: He focused on reducing corruption in the government and making it more transparent.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>The 1984 Setback and Comeback</h2>

        <p>However, politics is full of surprises. In 1984, NTR was unexpectedly removed from office by a group of people in his own party. Despite this setback, NTR made a remarkable comeback in 1985, leading the TDP to a victory in the next elections. This comeback proved his deep connection with the people of Andhra Pradesh.</p>

        <h2>His Lasting Impact</h2>

        <p>Even after his passing in 1996, NTR’s legacy continues. His son, **N. Chandrababu Naidu**, followed in his footsteps and became the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, continuing his father’s work. NTR is remembered for his courage, vision, and dedication to the people. </p>

        <p>He remains an iconic figure in both cinema and politics, a man who fought for the people’s rights and gave them a voice. NTR's name will always be remembered as a symbol of pride and strength for the Telugu people.</p>
